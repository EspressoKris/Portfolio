### Summary
Leukaemic stem cell (LSC) gene expression has recently been linked to prognosis
in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (17-gene LSC score, LSC-17) and myelod-
ysplastic syndromes. Although chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is re-
garded as a stem cell disorder, the clinical and biological impact of LSCs on CMML
patients remains elusive. Making use of multiple independent validation cohorts, we
here describe a concise three-gene expression signature (LSC-3, derived from the
LSC-17 score) as an independent and robust prognostic factor for leukaemia-free
and overall survival in CMML. We propose that LSC-3 could be used to supplement
existing risk stratification systems, to improve prognostic performance and guide
management decisions.
